I am a Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, broadly interested in the intersection of Computer Architecture and Distributed Systems.

Currently, I am conducting research on high-performance storage systems, specifically designing parallel filesystems optimized for AI workloads. I also serve as a Course Assistant for ECE 220, where I co-manage the Honors section and lead curriculum development. I previously studied abroad at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

I am currently applying to PhD programs for Fall 2026.
